# Swift-Pong
 A concept project using Swift with Raylib's C Interop.
 
 Simple Pong clone game with a survival twist, bounce the ball for as long as you can as the ball speeds with every hit on the paddle!
 The game will work perfectly fine on macOS when build. However, no sound will play as I was unable to figure out plethora of issues with SPMs resource management & C interop to Raylib.
