# Swift-Pong
 A (re-written) concept project using Swift Raylib from [Strega's Gate](https://github.com/STREGAsGate/Raylib) that solves many issues pure C interopt faced.
 
 It's a simple Pong clone game with a survival twist, bounce the ball for as long as you can as the ball speeds with every hit on the paddle! (yes, you can actually win)
 
 The game will work perfectly fine on macOS and Linux, probably even Windows if you try your best!
