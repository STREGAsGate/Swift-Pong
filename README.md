# Swift-Pong
 A concept project using Swift with Raylib's C Interop.
 
 Simple Pong clone game with a survival twist, bounce the ball for as long as you can as the ball speeds with every hit on the paddle!
 
 The game will work perfectly fine on macOS when built (You will need to have raylib installed on macOS). However, no sound will play as I was unable to figure out plethora of issues on macOS & SPMs resource management & C interop to Raylib.
